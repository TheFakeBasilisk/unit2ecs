  <h1><u>Example of Fake News</u></h1>
  <p>Today In breaking news, Jimmy the giraffe escaped his enclosure and ate a <br>
    5 year old boy named coyo tito and his 25 year old wife jeffery.
    <br>
    Luckily Jimmy the giraffe was able to escape into the wild.
    <br>
    <br>
    This was just an extreme example of a completley made up fake news article,<br>
    usually the articles will look semi-realistic
