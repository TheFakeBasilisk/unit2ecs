  <h1><u>Why Fake News Is Bad</u></h1>
  <p>The part of the reason that fake news is bad is because people have the <br>
    right to know the truth. Sometimes not knowing the truth can be dangerous,<br>
    some examples of good to know truths are:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>If theres a kidnapper in the area.</li>
  <br>
  <br>
  <li>If theres been a car crash near by.</li>
  <br>
  <br>
  <li>If theres a growing crime rate in your community.</li>
  <br>
  <p>etc.</p>
</ol>
